      </b>
    <p>
      <font face= "Alice" >   Coltivare was founded in 25 A.C (After Calamity) by John and Martha Coltive. Originally farmers themselves, they desired an easier way to get their products from their blackberry farm in the mountains down into the valley town's marketplace. To do so, they collaborated with the Trog engineer Arith to create the first delivery dirigible. Eventually, they found it was not only more profitable to create farming equipment for others, but more exciting as well. After selling their blackberry farm and forming a long term pact with Arith, they founded Coltivare farming equipment.</font>

  <p>
    <font face= "Alice"> With the success of the delivery dirigible, Coltivare was given the resources and reputation it needed to expand its product offering as well as its manufacturing capabilities. After observing an increased amount of Thunder Fish in the surrounding area, John Coltive asked Arith to design a lightning rod to protect other mountain farms. With the hiring of additional metal smiths, Arith created the requested lightning rods in under a year. These quickly became a very highly demanded product, with the capital and resources allowing for not only more metal smiths to be hired, but also textile workers and old tech conversion experts. Over the next eight years, Coltivare released more game breaking products, including the first Hugag cart harnesses, rain water collecters, and floating seedling planters. These products earned Coltivare the rank of 5th in <i> Shops of the New Age's</i> top 20 companies to look into.</font>
