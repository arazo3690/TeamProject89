      <font size= "4"face= "Georgia, Arial" color= "blue"> Our Company's Founding (25 A.C)</font>
      </b>
    <p>
      <font face= "Alice" >   Coltivare was founded in 25 A.C (After Calamity) by John and Martha Coltive. Originally farmers themselves, they desired an easier way to get their products from their blackberry farm in the Rocky Mountains down into the valley town's marketplace. To do so, they collaborated with the Trog engineer Arith to create the first delivery dirigible. Eventually, they found it was not only more profitable to create farming equipment for others, but more exciting as well. After selling their blackberry farm and forming a long term pact with Arith, they founded Coltivare farming equipment.</font>

  <p>
    <font face= "Alice"> With the success of the delivery dirigible, Coltivare was given the resources and reputation it needed to expand its product offering as well as its manufacturing capabilities. After observing an increased amount of Thunder Fish in the surrounding area, John Coltive asked Arith to design a lightning rod to protect other mountain farms. With the hiring of additional metal smiths, Arith created the requested lightning rods in under a year. These quickly became a very highly demanded product, with the capital and resources allowing for not only more metal smiths to be hired, but also textile workers and old tech conversion experts. Over the next eight years, Coltivare released more game breaking products, including the first Hugag cart harnesses, rain water collectors, and floating seedling planters. These products earned Coltivare the rank of 5th in <i> Shops of the New Age's</i> top 20 companies to look into.</font>

  <p>
    <font face= "Alice"> Sadly, in 38 A.C, at the age of 48, John Coltive passed. Due to the nature of his death, Martha Coltive requested we not share it here, but allowed us to quote her in saying "It was very violent." Managing of the company now passed solely to Martha and Arith. Despite John's death, the company continued to grow. As the tools of the old world began to rust and break after years of use, Coltivare began to expand into the common farm tool business, with their smiths and metalworkers beginning to forge the following products;</font>

    <font face= "Alice">In 53 A.C, after 25 years of running Coltivare, both Martha and Arith decided to retire. Management was transferred to five individuals; Alexander Herron, Helena DeMars, Hussain Alsinan, Isabella Wish, and Hunter Specht. You can read more about them <a href="https://hgspecht.github.io/Coltivare/team_page.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Under the new leadership, Coltivare continued to expand, establishing its first permanent store in New Denver, as well as utilizing draconid riders to deliver orders quicker and more efficiently. Presently, Coltivare has three forge/workshops scattered in the Rocky Mountains, a fleet of both delivery dirigibles and draconid riders, contracts with multiple kingdoms, towns, and provinces across the continent, and one physical store for the convenience of locals wanting high quality tools.
